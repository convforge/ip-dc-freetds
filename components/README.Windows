FROM SCRATCH
------------

These instructions should suffice in order to set up any project file you need.

1. FreeTDS compile with ANSI strings.

2. Every library have a proper directory where you can include every C file you find
inside (not recursively)

  * replacements here there is an exception, do not include ptw32_MCS_lock.c file
  * tds
  * dblib
  * ctlib
  * odbc

3. All libraries depends on replacements one (except replacements obviously),
dblib, ctlib and odbc depends on tds.

4. You should add ws2_32.lib to dependencies.

5. Replacements and TDS library are designed to be static libraries.

6. You have to define UNIXODBC macro (for ODBC stuff).

7. you need to include win32 and include directory (in this order!)
